## Reading questions

The first two questions are questions from last time, but worth
revisiting.  These are up rather late, but do what you can, and come
with questions for class!

1.  The class cluster consists of eight nodes and fifteen Xeon Phi
    accelerator boards.  Based on an online search for information on
    these systems, what do you think is the theoretical peak flop rate
    (double-precision floating point operations per second)?  Show how
    you computed this, and give URLs for where you got the parameters
    in your calculation.  (We will return to this question again after
    we cover some computer architecture.)

    Xeon Phi Board 
    (http://ark.intel.com/products/71992/Intel-Xeon-Phi-Coprocessor-5110P-8GB-1_053-GHz-60-core)
    x2 FLOPS/FMA: multiply and add in one cycle
    x8 FMA/vector FMA: 512 bits per vector/64 bits per double = 8 doubles as
        FMA inputs per vector
    x1 vector FMA/cycle
    x60 cores
    x1.053 GHz
    = 1.01088 petaflops/sec

    Xeon E5-2620 v3
    (http://ark.intel.com/products/83352/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-2620-v3-15M-Cache-2_40-GHz)
    x2 FLOPS/FMA
    x4 FMA/vector FMA: 256 bits per vector/64 bits per double = 4 doubles as
        FMA inputs per vector
    x2 vector FMA/cycle: 2 threads per core
    x6 cores
    x3.2 GHz
    = 307.2 gigaflops/sec

    15 * 1,010,880 gigaflops/sec + 8 * 307.2 gigaflops/sec 
    ~= 15.16566 petaflops/sec

    
2.  What is the approximate theoretical peak flop rate for your own machine?
    
    Intel Core i5 Haswell
    (http://ark.intel.com/products/75990/Intel-Core-i5-4258U-Processor-3M-Cache-up-to-2_90-GHz)
    x2 FLOPS/FMA
    x4 FMA/vector FMA
    x2 vector FMA/cycle : 2 threads per core
    x2 cores
    x2.9 GHz
    = 92.8 gigaflops/sec
    

3.  Suppose there are t tasks that can be executed in a pipeline
    with p stages.  What is the speedup over serial execution of the
    same tasks?

    Speedup in execution time: t/(1+(t-1)/p)   


4.  Consider the following list of tasks (assume they can't be pipelined):

      compile GCC (1 hr)
      compile OpenMPI (0.5 hr) - depends on GCC
      compile OpenBLAS (0.25 hr) - depends on GCC
      compile LAPACK (0.5 hr) - depends on GCC and OpenBLAS
      compile application (0.5 hr) - depends on GCC, OpenMPI,
        OpenBLAS, LAPACK

    What is the minimum serial time between starting to compile and having
    a compiled application?  What is the minimum parallel time given
    an arbitrary number of processors?

    Minimum serial time: 1 hr + 0.5 hr + 0.25 hr + 0.5 hr + 0.5 hr = 2.75 hr

    Minimum parallel time: 1 hr + 0.75 hr + 0.5 hr = 2.25 hr
    -Every task depends on GCC so we execute GCC first (1 hr)
    -Application depends on every other task so we execute it last (0.5 hr)
    -After GCC is complete, LAPACK depends on OpenBLAS and OpenMPI and OpenBLAS
    depend on nothing more, so we can run OpenMPI and OpenBLAS in parallel.
    -Once OpenBLAS is complete, we can run LAPACK in parallel to OpenMPI.
    -The running time of the parallel component is max(0.25 hr + 0.5 hr, 0.5 hr)
    = 0.75 hr.

    


5.  Clone the membench repository from GitHub:

       git clone git@github.com:cornell-cs5220-f15/membench.git

    On your own machine, build `membench` and generate the associated
    plots; for many of you, this should be as simple as typing `make`
    at the terminal (though I assume you have Python with pandas and
    Matplotlib installed; see also the note about Clang and OpenMP
    in the leading comments of the Makefile).  Look at the output file
    timings-heat.pdf; what can you tell about the cache architecture
    on your machine from the plot?

6.  From the cloned repository, check out the totient branch:

       git checkout totient

    You may need to move generated files out of the way to do this.
    If you prefer, you can also look at the files on GitHub.  Either
    way, repeat the exercise of problem 5.  What can you tell about
    the cache architecture of the totient nodes?

7.  Implement the following three methods of computing the centroid
    of a million two-dimensional coordinates (double precision).
    Time and determine which is faster:

    a.  Store an array of (x,y) coordinates; loop i and simultaneously
        sum the xi and yi

    b.  Store an array of (x,y) coordinates; loop i and sum the xi,
        then sum the yi in a separate loop

    c.  Store the xi in one array, the yi in a second array.
        Sum the xi, then sum the yi.

    I recommend doing this on the class cluster using the Intel
    compiler.  To do this, run "module load cs5220" and run (e.g.)

        icc -o centroid centroid.c
