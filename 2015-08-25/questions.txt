## How many are you?

In the first lecture, we ran a parallel protocol for counting attendance:

 - Rightmost person per row counts all in row
 - When done counting, raises hand
 - State number in row when called on

after which the instructor gets to gather and sum the row counts.

In practice, this took X time.  This includes

 - Time to start the process
 - Time to compute row counts
 - Time for the instructor to gather counts
 - Time for instructor to do the arithmetic

Consider the following questions:

1. What is a simple model that would predict this time?

a + nb + mc + md

where:
a is the time to start the process
b is the time to count one person
c is the time to receive a count for one row
d is the time to add a row count to the sum
n is the average number of people per row
m is the number of rows


2. What about a simple model to predict time for one person to count?

na + nb

where:
n is the number of people
a is the time to count one person
b is the time to add one to the sum


3. How big should the class be before the parallel method takes less time?

Quite large; ballpark estimate greater than 25. This is because in addition
to the overhead from starting each row operation and receiving the value,
the arithmetic takes longer using the parallel algorithm as well.
